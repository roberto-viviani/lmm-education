# Configuration modules

The config modules in LM Markdown for Education configure the application. There are two configuration files: config.toml and appchat.toml. The first contains settings that are common to the app and the rest of LM Markdown for Education (for example, when interacting with it through the CLI). The second contains settings that are specific to apps (the web applications). Both files are written in TOML format.

# LM markdown for education

LM markdown for education allows educators to develop lectures online, using language models for the interaction with students. It is a package developed at the Institute of Psychology at the University of Innsbruck.

LM markdown is a package that provides the instruments to edit and prepare markdown files, including for RAG. Educators can use markdown as a pivot document to review and prepare the material that they intend to serve in their education class. The reason to choose markdown is its versatility: instruments already exist to transform markdown documents into articles, books, or slides. Here, it may additionally be transformed into virtual lectures and language-model mediated interactions.

In addition, markdown is a simple format that allows the user to easily review and control its content. A key purpose of LM markdown for education is to give educators the instruments to exploit AI in their own teaching, as opposed to adopting an off-the-shelf package. When students interact with the chatbot produced by LM markdown for education, they interact with the material selected and prepared by the instructor. This means that educators remain the originators of the material that is used in teaching, but with the amplified capabilities given by the increased availability and interactivity of AI-based teaching.

The workflow for LM markdown for education starts from the collection of the teaching material. This material could be lecture notes, recordings of lectures, or anything that the teacher may want to develop expressely for the purpose of creating an AI-supported lecture series. The textual component of this material is then transformed into markdown format for review. Finally, the markdown documents are transformed into other artefacts, such as online lectures, a supportive RAG system, or a combination of the two.

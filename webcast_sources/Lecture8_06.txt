Finally, we specify the second component of the logistic regression: the link function. There are several available link functions that glm can fit, but for now we will just consider the logit. Do not forget to add this specification to glm. If you forget, glm will not complain and fit an ordinary regression instead. In this case, the linear predictor will specify the fit directly.

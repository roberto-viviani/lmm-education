The second thing to notice is that the first thing we specify is the model equation, just as we would do in ordinary regression. We specify outcome and predictors in exactly the same way. This is not just notation: we specify this model as in an ordinary regression because this model equation codes the linear predictor of the logistic regression. This is a linear component as in a linear regression.

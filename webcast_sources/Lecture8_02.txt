In the example we saw last week, we had a logistic regression predicting the probability that kids had to pass the final exam from the IQ of their mothers. In the plot of this slide, we have the IQs of mothers on the x axis, and passing the exam on the y axis. The observed data, plotted as points in the figure, only take the values of zero (failure) or one (success). As you can see, the fit is the prediction of the probability to pass the exam given IQ. The fit is a curve is constrained to lie between zero and one because probabilities can only take values between zero and one.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Located at the top of the page:

- **Total Questions**: Total number of questions asked across all sessions
  - *Metric*: Count of all user queries
  
- **Total Sessions**: Number of unique user sessions
  - *Metric*: Count of unique session hashes
  
- **Avg Response**: Average length of model responses
  - *Metric*: Mean character count of responses
  
- **Avg Query**: Average length of user questions
  - *Metric*: Mean character count of queries

#### Time Period Filters
Select your analysis timeframe:
- Last Day (24 hours)
- Last Week (7 days)
- Last Month (30 days)
- Last 3 Months (90 days)
- Last 6 Months (180 days)

All charts and metrics update dynamically based on selected period.

#### Visualizations

1. **Questions Over Time** (Line Chart)
   - Daily question volume trend
   - Shows engagement patterns and peaks

2. **Hourly Activity** (Bar Chart)
   - Distribution of questions by hour (UTC)
   - Identifies peak usage times

3. **Model Analysis**
   - Top models by usage frequency
   - Response length distribution across models

4. **Content Analysis**
   - Query length distribution (histogram)
   - Response length distribution (histogram)
   - Shows content complexity patterns

### 3. **Session Explorer** (`pages/02_session_explorer.py`)
Detailed view of individual user sessions with question-answer pairs.

#### Features

**Sorting Options:**
Access the sort menu next to "Sessions" count:
- **Newest first** (default) - Most recent sessions first
- **Oldest first** - Chronological order from beginning
- **Most messages** - Sessions with most Q&A pairs
- **Least messages** - Sessions with fewer interactions

**Session Display:**
Each session shows:
- Session number and timestamp
- Message count
- Model used
- Session duration

**Expandable Session Details:**
Click any session to expand and view:
- Session metadata (messages, model, duration)
- Complete question-answer pairs
- Timestamps for each interaction
- Q/A in side-by-side format for easy reading

## Understanding the Metrics

### Questions Metric
**Definition**: Total number of questions asked by users in the selected time period.
- **Significance**: Key indicator of platform engagement
- **Use Case**: Monitor user activity levels and trends

### Sessions Metric
**Definition**: Number of unique user sessions (based on session hash).
- **Significance**: Shows distinct user engagement instances
- **Use Case**: Track number of separate user interactions with the platform

### Response Length Metric
**Definition**: Average character count of AI-generated responses.
- **Significance**: Indicates response detail and complexity
- **Use Case**: Analyze if responses are getting more/less detailed over time

### Query Length Metric
**Definition**: Average character count of user questions.
- **Significance**: Shows question complexity and detail level
- **Use Case**: Understand user query sophistication

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Load
- Verify `messages.csv` exists in parent directory
- Check Python dependencies: `pip install streamlit pandas plotly`
- Ensure Streamlit is up to date: `pip install --upgrade streamlit`

### Data Not Updating
- Page cache may need refresh: Press `R` in Streamlit UI
- Check `messages.csv` modification time
- Verify data file path is correct

### Charts Not Displaying
- Ensure data exists for selected time period
- Try shorter time range if data is sparse
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
